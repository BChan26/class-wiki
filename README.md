  <h3>Jay Thurber</h3>
  <h4>Instructor Associate</h4>
  <p>Hey everyone! I’m Jay and I will be one of your Instructional Associates for this course! I worked as a nurse for 10 years before taking the plunge into tech, graduating General Assembly’s SEIR program in October 2021, and have since been both an IA and TA for five cohorts. I love hyping up and motivating my students, as well as being a part of those “Aha!” moments, especially considering I was a student like yourselves not long ago!
In my free time, you can find me playing board games with my wife and friends, hiking with my two dogs, cooking, watching anime, working on personal projects, and as of recently climbing! :woman_climbing:</p>
